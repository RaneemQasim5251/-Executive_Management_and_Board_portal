# Power BI Embedding Error Fix

## 🚨 Current Issue
The Power BI React component is throwing "Embed URL is invalid for this scenario" error even with a valid access token.

## ✅ Immediate Solution

Add this to your `.env` file to force stable iframe mode:

```bash
VITE_FORCE_IFRAME_MODE=true
```

This will bypass the React component entirely and use secure iframe embedding.

## 🔧 How It Works

The system now has three modes:

### 1. Safe Mode (Recommended) 🛡️
```bash
VITE_FORCE_IFRAME_MODE=true
```
- ✅ Always uses iframe embedding
- ✅ Avoids React component compatibility issues
- ✅ More stable and reliable
- ✅ Works with or without access token

### 2. Advanced Mode ⚡
```bash
VITE_FORCE_IFRAME_MODE=false
VITE_POWERBI_ACCESS_TOKEN=your-token-here
```
- Uses Power BI React component
- More features but can have compatibility issues
- Requires valid access token

### 3. Fallback Mode ⚠️
```bash
# No VITE_POWERBI_ACCESS_TOKEN
```
- Automatically uses iframe
- Basic functionality only

## 🎯 Quick Setup Steps

1. **Add to your `.env` file:**
   ```bash
   VITE_POWERBI_CLIENT_ID=ab13106b-99f4-416d-aa53-a0ca9d3175ca
   VITE_POWERBI_TENANT_ID=ba2cab20-721a-44f0-bec4-f2e784ba3c23
   VITE_FORCE_IFRAME_MODE=true
   
   # Optional: Add your access token
   VITE_POWERBI_ACCESS_TOKEN=your-token-here
   ```

2. **Restart your development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Expected Result:**
   - 🛡️ Blue "Safe mode" alert
   - ✅ No more React component errors
   - ✅ Power BI reports display in iframe
   - ✅ All navigation works properly

## 🔍 Debug Information

When `VITE_FORCE_IFRAME_MODE=false`, you'll see debug info boxes showing the embed URLs being used. This helps identify URL format issues.

## 🚀 Benefits of Safe Mode

- **Stability**: No React component crashes
- **Compatibility**: Works with all Power BI report types
- **Security**: Proper iframe sandboxing
- **Performance**: Faster loading
- **Reliability**: Consistent behavior across browsers

## 🔄 Switching Back to Advanced Mode

Once Microsoft fixes the React component issues, you can switch back by:

1. Set `VITE_FORCE_IFRAME_MODE=false`
2. Ensure you have a valid `VITE_POWERBI_ACCESS_TOKEN`
3. Restart the development server

## 💡 Recommendation

**Use Safe Mode (iframe) for production** - it's more stable and reliable for end users.
